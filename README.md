# MARS
MARS (official) MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator

 MARS is a lightweight interactive development environment (IDE) for programming in MIPS assembly language, intended for educational-level use with Patterson and Hennessy's Computer Organization and Design.
 MARS was developed by Pete Sanderson and Ken Vollmar and can be found at https://dpetersanderson.github.io/.

 This fork of MARS is a research project undertaken by John Edelman, Jun Law, and Dominic Dabish in summer 2025, aiming to modernize MARS and specifically to enable students to specify their own custom assembly languages for use with the MARS simulator.

 This fork of the research project undertaken by John Edelman, Jun Law, and Dominic Dabish in summer 2025 ^^^ adds a custom language called "Sus-32 Assembly".

 To run, open up MARS, navigate to tools in the top menu, and select language switcher.
 A separate window should appear, from there choose the second language called "Sus-32 Assembly".
 *NOTE: For some odd reason, it appears twice; make sure to use the version that includes taskset as an operand*

 There is also a PDF reference sheet called "SUS-32 "Among Us" Reference Sheet" for your guidance on the instructions.
